Certainly! Here are the answers to the Django interview questions:

What is Django? Explain its main features.

Django is a high-level Python web framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It simplifies the process of building web applications by providing a set of tools and libraries for handling common web development tasks. Its main features include an ORM for database operations, URL routing, template engine, form handling, authentication, and more.
What is the purpose of the Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)?

The Django ORM allows developers to interact with the database using Python objects instead of writing raw SQL queries. It provides an abstraction layer that maps database tables to Python classes, allowing easy creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of records.
What is a Django project? How is it different from a Django app?

A Django project is a collection of settings, configurations, and applications that make up a complete web application. It represents the entire website or web application. In contrast, a Django app is a modular component within a project that provides a specific functionality. A project can consist of multiple apps.
Explain the concept of Django migrations.

Django migrations are a way to manage database schema changes over time. They allow developers to create, update, and synchronize the database schema with the models defined in Django. Migrations track the changes made to models and apply those changes to the database, making it easier to manage database schema updates without manually writing SQL statements.
What is the Django template engine? How does it work?

The Django template engine is a component that allows developers to define the structure and presentation of the HTML pages in a Django application. It uses template files that contain placeholders and logic for rendering dynamic content. The template engine processes these templates, replaces the placeholders with actual values, and generates HTML pages to be sent to the client's browser.
What is the role of Django's URL dispatcher?

The URL dispatcher in Django is responsible for matching incoming URLs with corresponding views. It maps URL patterns to specific views or functions that handle the request. The URL dispatcher examines the requested URL, compares it against the defined URL patterns, and then calls the associated view or function to generate a response.
How does Django handle forms and form validation?

Django provides a form handling mechanism that simplifies the process of working with HTML forms. It allows developers to define form classes based on models or custom requirements. Django handles form rendering, data binding, validation, and error handling. It provides built-in form fields and validation rules, making it easier to process user input securely.
What are Django models? Explain how they are used.

Django models are Python classes that define the structure and behavior of database tables. They act as a high-level representation of database tables, enabling developers to interact with the database using objects. Models define fields, relationships, and methods to perform database operations. Django's ORM maps these models to database tables and provides an API for performing CRUD operations.
What is the purpose of Django's authentication system?

Django's authentication system provides a secure way to manage user authentication and authorization in web applications. It handles tasks such as user registration, login, logout, password management, and access control. It includes features like password hashing, session management, and user permissions, making it easier to implement secure user authentication.
How does Django handle caching?

Django provides a caching framework that allows developers to cache the results of expensive or repetitive operations to improve performance. It supports various cache backends such as in-memory cache, database cache, file-based cache, and more. Developers can use decorators or template tags to specify which parts of the application should be
